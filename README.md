ZendStudio 10 - Configs

I have been having serious issues recently with imported projects in ZendStudio10 and autocomplete failing. 

Attached are my .project and .buildpath files for ZF2 projects for a project I know has autocomplete working correctly. You must replace the project name placeholder in the .project file.
